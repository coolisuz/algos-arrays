Credit Card Validation - Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn formula is sometimes used to validate credit card numbers. Create the 
function isCreditCardValid(digitArr) that accepts an array of digits on the 
card (13-19 depending on the card), and returns a boolean whether the card 
digits satisfy the Luhn formula, as follows:

1 - Set aside the last digit; don't include it in these calculations (until step 5)

2 - Starting from the back, multiply the digits in odd positions 
    (last, third-to-last, etc.) by 2;
3 - If any results are larger than 9, subtract 9 from them;

4 - Add all numbers (not just our odds) together;
5 - Now add the last digit back in â€“ the sum should be a multiple of 10.

For example, when given digit array [5,2,2,8,2], after step 1) it becomes 
[5,2,2,8], then after step 2) it is [5,4,2,16]. Post-3) we have [5,4,2,7], 
then following 4) it becomes 18. After step 5) our value is 20, so ultimately 
we return true. If the final digit were any non-multiple-of-10, we would 
instead return false.

        if (i % 2 !== 0) arr[i] *= 2
        if (arr[i] > 9) arr[i] -= 9
        sum += arr[i]
    }
    return (sum + lastNum) % 10 === 0;
