/*
Shuffle

In JavaScript, the Array object has numerous useful methods. It does not, 
however, contain a method that will randomize the order of an array’s elements. 
Let’s create shuffle(arr), to efficiently shuffle a given array’s values. Work 
in-place, naturally. Do you need to return anything from your function?

const shuffle = arr => {
    for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j=i; j<arr.length; j++) {
            
        }
    }
}
