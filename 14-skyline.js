Skyline Heights

Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say 
you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest 
to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: 
first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 
stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are 
situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can 
see, in order. 

Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. 
Given [0,4] return [4]. 
As always with challenges, don't use built-in array functions such as unshift()
